This is an AR app using the front camera, I added some mustaches and a button to change it, it works at any display orientation, and it has all the permissions needed for AR. For guidance, I followed Kristina's codelab and some other resources

There are some other buttons in progress.

How to test it? 
To test its functionalities it is required to run it on Android Studio with a device that has a front camera so you can see the 3D object on your face. It is able to run from API 24 to the last android version.
